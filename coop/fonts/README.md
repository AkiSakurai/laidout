FONTS
-----

This directory contains various utilities and resources to help tinker
with fonts with Laidout.


`parseletters.py` is used to guillotine an svg into individual glyph svg files and a ttx file
that the ttx utility from fonttools can parse into an OTF svg based color font.
Note currently this is limited to stroke and fill as solid colors.
