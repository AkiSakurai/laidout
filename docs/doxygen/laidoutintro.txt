Laidout
-------
Version 0.097.1\n

Currently in the "A bit of a hack, but mostly works on my machine" stage of development.

If you want to hack away at Laidout, you've come to the right place. Please be
advised that any part of Laidout code may completely change without notice.

Laidout has existed since around 2004.
It is my sprawling desktop publishing software that I've been making on and off since then,
which is many years longer than I really expected to want to be doing.
Half of that time has been spent developing the 
<a href="https://github.com/Laidout/laxkit">Laxkit</a>, the window toolkit that
Laidout is built upon.

So, why, really, should any one use Laidout rather than Inkscape, Scribus, or even InDesign?
Well, you shouldn't!! Right now, Laidout is still very experimental, and no printing house anywhere
supports its files, or has even heard of it. If you need something with a proven history, then go for
Scribus. It apparently produces very clean files that printing houses will probably not hate you for.
The major deficiency of Scribus (as of November 2020) is the lack of impositioning features.


The Saga of Desktop Publishing under Linux
------------------------------------------

The Story So Far...

One thing I love to do is make various little books of my artwork, and sometimes t-shirts or 
other silkscreening. It is relatively inexpensive to make small runs of books that can 
often pass for high quality 
printing with careful photocopying, and perfect binding. I looked and looked for some program 
that filled my needs, and didn't cost thousands of dollars like Quark, Photoshop, or InDesign 
running on a Mac. That left me with Linux on a cheap computer. While searching for some 
bookmaking software, I encountered several possibilities such as Scribus, Passepartout, Inkscape,
Lyx, Latex/TeX, and Openoffice, which were all unsuitable for
one reason or another. 


I wanted, and still want, a program with the following characteristics.
Only parts of this has so far been implemented in Laidout!
Hopefully some day Laidout will do all of these things.  

See  http://laidout.org/dtpcompare.html for something resembling a feature wishlist.


- Layout capabilities for little pamphlets as well as books of several hundred graphics heavy pages, books 
  with signatures, foldings, etc. For instance, from an 11x17 paper, you can cut and fold 
  to produce 3 little squarish books (see Bike Propaganda). None of the above (free) programs are
  designed for such pagesetting features. In the era of photocopiers and zines, that is unfortunate.

- WYSIWYG font and image layout, taking into account paper color, and basic ink interaction, particularly
  useful for such projects as screen printing on colored t-shirts

- Scripting 

- Minimal windows and icons yet robust interfaces. Making full use of 3 button mice with a 
  wheel, and keyboard shortcuts sure cuts 
  down on screen clutter, while still being versatile and efficient. For reference, I am a 
  fan of vi, Blender, and the Openbox window manager (flame on!). 

- robust text wrapping, text on a line, kerning, minor leading adjustments...
- robust transformation and arrangement tools
- Plugin architecture to make it potentially adaptable to do basic cad things, like 
  room layouts, or perhaps even tv/movie animation schemes where 1 page is 1 frame, make nets 
  for fold up polyhedron, for
  instance a calendar printed on the 12-sided dodecahedron, etc.


\section donate Donate!

While this program is released under the GPL, free for you to use and modify any way you want (as 
long as you credit things appropriately), it takes resources to keep the devs alive. Therefore, 
if you think this program is worth the drive space, please, please send donations of money, fresh 
fruit (fresh upon the recipient receiving it intact in person), hardware, ski resort reservations,
etc to the developers found on http://www.laidout.org .
